<p style="justify"> OHANA means family so this is my family. I have 3 brothers and I am the only girl in the family. My father's name is Kamaruzzaman B Abd Ghani. He was born in Pulau Pinang. My mother's name is Nor Aswarz Bt Muhamed and she is from Kota Bharu, Kelantan. My oldest brother stayed in Pulau Pinang because he is working there while my second brother is in Kuala Lumpur and he is also working. In 2018, we were gifted a very beautiful niece, named Arianna Dalisha Bt Amirul Azfar. She is 2 years old now and she brings light to the family</p>
