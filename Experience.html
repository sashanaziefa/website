<p>Before I continue my studies in degree, I am taking my diploma in Polymer Technology at UITM Arau for 3 years. During my last semester, I need to do industrial training around 3 months. I have completed my industrial training in SPEN INDUSTRIES which is located in Bukit Minyak, Pulau Pinang. SPEN Industries Sdn.Bhd specialized in precision reinforced engineering plastic, insert and parting-line injection moulding.During my internship, I was assigned as quality control which is I need to check all the productions of the company. It was very tough since I was the only one quality control in the company and I also learn a few things in the office such as handling invoices of the company. Every morning, I need to check all the machines and products and after that every one hour I need to check the products to avoid any defects. If there is any defects, we need to stop the productions as soon as possible. Although it is quite though but it was a very meaningful experience as I can learn so many things there.</p>
